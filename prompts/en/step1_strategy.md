Hey, Agent!

Based on the provided Technical Specification (TS) for the project **PROJECT NAME**, generate a **Development Strategy**.

Create a file `docs/development_strategy.md` with the following structure and content, tailored to this project:

---

## 1. Project Overview

- Brief description of the project's goals and objectives (based on the TS).
- Main features the product should provide.

## 2. Proposed Architectural Approach

- Recommendations on the overall architecture (e.g., monolith, microservices, modular structure). Justify your choice.
- Key system components and their intended interactions.

## 3. Key Technologies and Frameworks

- Confirm or suggest a technology stack (programming languages, frameworks, libraries, databases) that best fits the project according to the TS. Justify your choice.

## 4. Proposed Project Structure

- Recommendations for organizing directories and files in the project (e.g., `src/`, `app/`, `data/`, `tests/`, `docs/`).
- Brief description of the purpose of the main directories.

## 5. Core Development Principles

- **Code Style:** Reference to a widely accepted code style for the chosen language (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- **Error Handling and Logging:** General principles for exception handling and logging.
- **Testing:** Suggestions for a testing strategy (e.g., unit, integration, E2E). Which types of tests are critical for this project?
- **Naming:** General principles for naming variables, functions, classes, files, etc.
- **Comments and Code Documentation:** Approach to code commenting and API documentation (if applicable).

## 6. Main Development Stages/Modules

- High-level breakdown of the project into logical blocks, modules, or sequential development stages derived from the TS.

## 7. Interaction with the AI Agent (You)

- How will you request clarifications from the user?
- How will you report progress and any issues?
- What format will you use to provide a report on completed work (if required)?

Analyze the TS carefully. If any aspects of the strategy are unclear from the TS, ask clarifying questions.

The result of your work should be the file `docs/development_strategy.md`.
