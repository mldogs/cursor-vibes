Hey, Agent!

Please create a file `docs/changelog_agent.json` to log all future changes in the codebase of the project **PROJECT NAME**.

The file should be a JSON array. Add the first entry documenting the project initialization and creation of artifacts (TS was provided, strategy and tasks were just created by you). Use the following structure for this and all subsequent entries:

{
  "change_id": "CL-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-NNN", // Unique change ID (e.g., CL-20250728-103000-001)
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",   // Timestamp
  "actor": "Cursor Agent",
  "user_request_summary": "Brief description of the request or stage that led to the change (e.g., 'Project initialization and creation of artifacts per Instructions 1-3').",
  "task_id_ref": null, // For this first entry, you can leave it null or specify a general preparation task if there was one.
  "files_affected": [
    {"path": "docs/development_strategy.md", "status": "created"},
    {"path": "data/tasks.json", "status": "created"},
    {"path": "data/changelog_agent.json", "status": "created"}
    // If the TS is also present in the project, add: {"path": "path/to/TS.md", "status": "referenced"}
  ],
  "change_summary": "Project initialized. Core artifacts created: development strategy, task list, and changelog.",
  "agent_reasoning": "Infrastructure prepared for further development according to the meta-workflow.",
  "tags": ["project_setup", "initialization", "project_artifacts"]
}

In the future, after completing each task from `docs/tasks.json` and making changes to the code, you must add a new entry to this file detailing the changes made.

The result of your work should be the file `docs/changelog_agent.json` with one initial entry.
